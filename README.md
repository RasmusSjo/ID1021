<h1>ID1021 - Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>

<p>Repository for the course Algorithms and Data Structures - ID1021.</p>

<h2>Course summary</h2>

<p>
This course covered topics such as algorithm analysis, basic algorithms (including search and sorting), fundamental data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees), and practical program construction. I learned to describe, compare, and implement these concepts, enabling me to construct programs that solve computational problems. The course consisted of 9 mandatory assignments and 4 higher-grade assignments and the assignments were completed using Java.

<h2>Folder structure</h2>

<p>All assignments can be found in the "src" folder within a package corresponding to their name. Below is a list of the different assignments (in chronological order) and a brief explanation of them. The purpose of each assignment was to implement an algorithm and/or a data structure and benchmark these to test their performance. In the "utils" folder, some utility classes can be found. The "Benchmarker" class contains all the benchmarks conducted during the course. The "LatexHelper" class contains methods for constructing "Latex" tables, and lastly, the ArrayGenerator contains methods for constructing and manipulating arrays.</p>
