<h1>Repository for the course Algorithms and Data Structures - ID1021.</h1>

<p>
This course covered topics such as algorithm analysis, basic algorithms (including search and sorting), fundamental data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees), and practical program construction. I learned to describe, compare, and implement these concepts, enabling me to construct programs that solve computational problems. The course consisted of 10 mandatory assignments and 4 higher-grade assignments.
